  I'm a mecatronic engineer with over 14 years experience in industrial automation.
  <br>
  I like to work on challenging projects, independently, or as a team member.
  <br>
  Being curious and creative help me to push my limits everyday.
  My willingness to help and understand customer or colleague needs brings good working relationships based on trust.
  <br>
  My position as technical office manager enforce my links with sales department and help me to improve soft skills like scheduling, priorisation or strategic decision-making.
  <br>
  Thanks to my experience working for an innovative supplier, I developped knowledges on many solutions in different industries of industrial automation.
  Even though I'm most skilled in:
  <br>
  <mark>Software architecture</mark> <mark>Motion control</mark> <mark>CNC</mark> <mark>Robotic</mark> <mark>IEC 61131-3</mark>
